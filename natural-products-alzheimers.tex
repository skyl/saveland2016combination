% Safety
\section{Safety}

Most of the promising natural products used for AD
are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food supplements.
Some specific products have been tested in human safety trials.



Turmeric is considered safe in normal doses.
Curcumin is considered safe up to several grams a day in normal subjects.
However, several contraindications have been identified.
There is also the possibility of allergic reaction.
Interactions have also been noted.
Some interactions may be valuable, if carefully applied.
For instance, co-administration with piperine resulted in a
20000\% increase in the bioavailability of curcumin.

% Challenges
\section{Challenges}


% Standardization
A major concern raised about crude natural products is
the challenge of standardization.


A formulation called kamikihito (KKT) in Japan
and kami-guibi-tang (KGT) in Korea
were comparable in enhancing memory in an animal model,
although chromatography revealed differences in the formulations.
\cite{watari2015comparing}


% Publication bias
Though there are many studies indicating that
a combination of natural products should be effective
AD treatment, we do not see many studies that
failed to find evidence that a natural combination
should be effective.
Thus, we do not know to what extent our review falls victim
to publication bias.
% Chinese national pride bias towards TCM?
